# live-log-laugh
The worst option for logging in Python
Thank you MCodingLLC for the terrible idea, since he said not to do this.

## Import the library and add to your function as a decorator
``` 
from live-log-laugh import love
@love
def Function():
  print("test")

```
## Logs will be saved based on the config imported
